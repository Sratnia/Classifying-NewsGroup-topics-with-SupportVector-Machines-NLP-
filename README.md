# Classifying-NewsGroup-topics-with-SupportVector-Machines-NLP-
This project is about classifying newsgroups based on some text. The provided dataset originated from the sci-kit learn library. So, our work is to fetch the dataset from the sci-kit learns library and analyze the data and given target, which are different types of newsgroups. To work with text data, we will use various NLP libraries in python to clean and present the data so that our model can understand the text data. We will be removing unwanted characters like different stopwords(like:- as, the, is, etc.), lemmatize words(like:- ran, running- run(root word)), and remove punctuations to simplify the written text. As a final step, we will convert our text to numeric form with the help of the TF-IDF vectorizer in the sci-kit learns feature extraction library. Now our text data is cleaned and restored to a numeric state; this data can be fed to our machine-learning algorithm to predict various newsgroups. We will be converting our data into training and testing data and training our model with the help of the Support vector machine algorithm. To test our trained model's performance, we will evaluate the result based on new predictions on test data. Our model achieved an accuracy of 97% with just simple basic steps. We can perform advanced steps to clean text data and gain more accuracy.
